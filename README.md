## 🔍 Abstract
The project "Romispace," conducted by Johannes Stölzle, Dylan Cetina, Linus Itten, and Darvin Lüders, explores the fundamental physics of rocketry through the development and testing of the water rocket "Orion". The propulsion of the vehicle is based on the recoil principle, which utilizes Newton’s Third Law of motion where an action (actio) triggers an equal and opposite reaction (reactio) in conjunction with the law of conservation of momentum. In this experimental setup, air is compressed within a PET bottle using a pump to increase internal pressure, which then forces water through a nozzle to create downward thrust, accelerating the rocket in the opposite upward direction. The "Orion" rocket construction features stability fins, a nose cone, and a specialized nozzle assembly connected to a manual release valve system.
To monitor flight dynamics, the team integrated a Micro:bit sensor to record real-time acceleration and altitude data during the experimental launches. A critical component of the design is the recovery system, which utilizes a parachute connected to both segments of the rocket; this parachute is designed to deploy automatically at the apex of the flight path to facilitate a controlled descent. Flight analysis conducted on January 24, 2025, revealed that the rocket reached a peak altitude of 55 meters approximately 3 seconds after the launch sequence began at the 2-second mark. The parachute recovery system successfully activated between 5 and 6 seconds into the flight, resulting in a significantly slowed descent and a safe landing after a total duration of 16 to 20 seconds. Although the parachute principle was effectively demonstrated, the team concluded that the precision of the altitude and acceleration measurements has room for improvement. Future development for the "Orion" project includes the integration of a larger fuel tank and the use of a professional compressor to achieve higher internal pressure and improved flight performance.
